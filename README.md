# EDA in E-Commerce Data using Python
EDA, short for Exploratory and Explanatory Data Analysis, is being applied to an e-commerce dataset that captures a wide range of online transaction details. The dataset comprises 4,870 entries across 8 distinct features. Each feature offers specific insights into customer behavior and sales patterns:
-InvoiceNo: A distinct identifier assigned to each transaction, whether it's a sale or return
- StockCode: A unique code representing each product listed
- Description: Textual details or names associated with each product
- Quantity: The total number of items involved in a transaction
- InvoiceDate: The exact timestamp when the transaction was recorded
- UnitPrice: The cost of a single unit of an item
- CustomerID: A unique identifier linked to each individual customer
- Country: The country associated with the customer or where the transaction originated
 ## Project Objective
This analysis aims to deliver both a foundational overview and in-depth insights into transaction activities recorded between December 2010 and December 2011. The focus is on uncovering key trends and patterns within the dataset, including:
- Top-selling products based on total sales volume
- Countries generating the highest sales figures
- The relationship between unit price and quantity sold
- High-value customers with the most significant purchase activity
